A Sui Move smart contract project.

toc::[]

== Overview

Boris Boarman is a Move smart contract project built on the Sui blockchain that implements a secure fund release mechanism. The smart contract enables authorized parties to release funds to specified recipients in a controlled and secure manner.

=== Key Features

* *Secure Fund Release*: Implements a `release_funds` function that transfers specified amounts to recipient wallets
* *Authorization Controls*: Ensures only authorized entities can initiate fund releases through access control modifiers
* *Integration Ready*: Designed to work with frontend applications and backend services through standard APIs
* *Security First*: Implements robust validation and authorization checks before any fund transfers

=== Flow Overview

1. Users interact with a frontend interface to initiate fund claims
2. Backend validates the request and interacts with the smart contract
3. Smart contract verifies authorization and executes the fund transfer
4. Funds are securely transferred to the recipient's wallet address

== Prerequisites

* Sui CLI installed
* Move language knowledge
* Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
